# Frequently Added Issues

### Multiple adventures in one embed / Other user is in the same adventure embed

We know, it's an issue with the library, we can't do anything.

### I can't link the android app / The linker on the app is broken

We know of this, we're working on a new app, but we currently don't have an ETA.

### I can't sell lemons!

Not a bug, it's intended behaviour, use the global market instead.

### The bot is emitting an error saying `DiscordAPIError: Missing Permissions at... (blah, blah, blah)`

Please make sure that the bot has the following permissions:
- Embed Links
- Manage Messages
- Add Reactions

*and if you want to display your guild tag and level (except server owner)*
- Manage Nicknames

### Are the cooldown timers going to be lowered or removed?

Nope, never will *at least not at player request*.

### Can I get unbanned?

Head over to the [official server](https://discord.discorddungeons.me). Cases should not be discussed here at all and will result in the issue being closed immediately.
